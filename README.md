I'm building a **"Country Explorer"** web app: a card-based gallery of countries, each showing pictures, fun facts, major cities, and other cool info.

---

## 🧩 Features Overview

Let’s start with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

### 🗺️ **Country Info Cards**

Each card can show:

* 🖼️ Country image (flag or landscape)
* 🇫🇷 Name of country
* 🎉 Fun fact
* 🏙️ Major cities (list or scrollable)
* 📍Continent or region

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack Suggestion

* **Frontend:** React
* **Styling:** CSS Modules or Tailwind
* **Data:** JSON or API (like [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/))
* **Optional:** LocalStorage to save favorites

---

## 🖼️ UI Preview (Wireframe Idea)

I’ll design a clean card layout grid like this:

```
+----------------------------------+
| [Image of France]               |
| 🇫🇷 France                       |
| Fun Fact: Eiffel Tower is repainted every 7 years!  
| Major Cities: Paris, Lyon, Marseille  
| Region: Europe  
+----------------------------------+
```

## 🪄 Let's Start With:

1. **Figma Design** – simple desktop + mobile version
2. **Basic React Structure** – App, CountryCard, data.json
